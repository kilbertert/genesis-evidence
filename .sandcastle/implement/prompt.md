# TASK

Implement issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

You are on branch `{{BRANCH}}`, already created from `main`. Pull in the
issue with `gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --comments`. If it has a
parent PRD, pull that in too.

# CONTEXT

Read `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/`, `.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md`, and any relevant ADRs under
`docs/adr/` before starting. Explore the repo and fill your context with the parts
relevant to this issue — especially test files that touch the area
you'll change.
Run the Economy ladder before choosing an implementation; stop at the first
option that fully satisfies the issue and its acceptance contract.

# EXECUTION

Use red-green-refactor where applicable.

1. RED: write one failing test
2. GREEN: implement to pass it
3. REPEAT until the issue is done
4. REFACTOR

Before committing, run `uv sync --extra dev && uv run pytest && uv run ruff check`, then
`node .sandcastle/policy-check.mjs commit`.

This repo HAS a project verification skill, `.claude/skills/verify-genesis-evidence`.
If your change alters behavior a reviewer or a patient-facing consumer can
observe, run that skill and capture its evidence before committing. Tests are not
a substitute: it drives the real service against a throwaway database. **Never
point it at `var/genesis-evidence.sqlite3`.** Its evidence is usually gitignored,
so put what you rely on somewhere the commit carries. If you cannot run it, say
so and why in the commit body; do not report it as done.

# COMMIT

Make one or more git commits on `{{BRANCH}}`. Use conventional-commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`). Do NOT use a `RALPH:` prefix — that prefix is reserved for the RALPH loop.

Do not close the issue yourself.
